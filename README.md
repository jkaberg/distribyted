## Distribyted

Distribyted is an alternative torrent client. 
It can expose torrent files as a standard FUSE, webDAV or HTTP endpoint and download them on demand, allowing random reads using a fixed amount of disk space. 

Distribyted tries to make easier integrations with other applications using torrent files, presenting them as a standard filesystem.
